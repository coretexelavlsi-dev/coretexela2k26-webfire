            <h3>About the Founder</h3>
            <p>
                This platform is created by an Electronics and Communication Engineering student
                with a strong interest in practical learning, VLSI, embedded systems, and real
                industry exposure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is simple: remove confusion, provide clarity, and help students
                understand concepts the way industry expects.

            <p>
                You don’t need to know everything. You just need the right direction,
                consistency, and hands-on practice. This platform is built to support you
                in that journey.
